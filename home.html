          <h3>Purpose and Objectives</h3>
          <p>Acadify was created with a clear purpose: to address the challenges that students face in accessing academic resources. <br>The primary goals of Acadify are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Facilitate Resource Sharing: Provide a platform where students can freely share and access academic materials such as PDF books, journals, <br>articles, and school notes.</li>
            <li>Foster Community Collaboration: Build a supportive community where students can interact, discuss topics, and collaborate on academic endeavors.</li>
            <li>Promote Educational Equity: Ensure that all students, regardless of financial constraints, have access to essential academic resources to support their learning journeys.</li><br><br><br>
          </ul>
        </div><br>
        <div class="problem">
          <h3>Problem Statement and Need</h3>
          <p>The idea for Acadify emerged from the observation that many students encounter obstacles in acquiring costly academic resources, which can hinder their educational progress. Acadify seeks to bridge this gap by creating a platform where students can share their unused study materials and benefit from resources contributed by others.</p>

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
      </div>
      </div><br>
        <center>
        <p>Acadify's architecture is designed to support efficient resource sharing, community interaction, <br>and seamless user experiences. Below is an overview of the project's architecture, <br>describing its key components and interactions.</p><br>
        </center>

        <p><b> Architecture Diagram </b></p><br>
      </center>
      <br><p>The architecture of Acadify consists of several components that work together to deliver a cohesive platform for students:</p><br>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h4>Frontend (Client-Side):</h4>
              <p>The frontend of Acadify is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a responsive and interactive experience for users accessing the platform through web browsers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Backend (Server-Side):</h4>
              <p>The backend of Acadify is powered by Node.js and Express.js, which handle server-side logic and API endpoints. This component manages data retrieval, storage, and authentication processes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Database Management:</h4>
              <p>Acadify utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store and manage academic resources, user profiles, and community interactions. MongoDB's flexibility and scalability are leveraged to accommodate dynamic data requirements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Authentication and Security:</h4>
              <p>Authentication and security measures are implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.js to protect user credentials.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Deployment and Infrastructure:</h4>
              <p>Acadify is deployed using WordPress, a popular content management system (CMS), which provides flexibility and scalability for managing and hosting the platform's content and functionalities. WordPress allows for easy customization and integration of plugins, making it suitable for Acadify's requirements.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        <div class="components-interactions">
          <h3>Components and Interactions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Client-Server Interaction:</strong> The frontend communicates with the backend server via RESTful API endpoints to fetch data and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Database Integration:</strong> MongoDB is integrated with the backend to store and retrieve data efficiently. Data models and schemas are defined to maintain consistency and structure within the database.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication Flow:</strong> User authentication is managed through JWT tokens, where users receive tokens upon successful login and use them to access protected routes and resources.</li>
          </ul>
